Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client I worked with within this project was Artemis Financial who are a finance company who built themselves on creating saving and investmebt plans for people. Their intentions in this project was needing a file authentication phase built into their existing system to enable secure communication and file trasnfers for clients and sensitvie data. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Overall I feel that I was able to read to the dependency checks very well and was sucsessful in identifying false positives. These areas are exceptoional imporant for a developer because running a vunerabilties is one thing and being able to understand it and use it to properly improve and zecure the code is another thing. By reviewing the reports while also properly identifying false positives within the test we are ensuring tthat data in the code will be protected at all times. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part for me personally with this project and using the vulnerabiliys check was figuring out how to properly run it on the project. It was very challenging because when I would run the reports and assesments I would often run into errors that prevented the checks getting ran. Once this issue was overcome however, I found them to be very informative and helpful with identifying specific issues. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
The best practice to increasing layers would be that once the vulerability had been identifyed and ranked from low, moderate to high risk we first work down the list from the highest risk issues down to the lower risk. This involves static and dynamic testing, editing the code as well as some code refractoring to ensure the software vulnerabilities could not be exploited in anyway. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
In order to make sure the software was functional it required using many dynamic and static tests on the code to make sure none of the vulnerabilities the checks had detected could be exploited or used to grant unwanted access to the system and to protect the client and their data. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The introduction of Maven and teh dependancy check was one of the most facinating and useful tools I learned to use in this course and will definitely continue to use it in future courses and projects as it helps with identifying weak points within the software. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
One useful example I could show potential emplpyers would be dependancy and vunerability checks. This would further showcase my knoweledge and experience with securing and improving software.
